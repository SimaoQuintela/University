    <description>This workflow shows how to work with spreadsheets that come in a non-standard format using KNIME Analytics Platform. The aim is to clean up and rearrange a spreadsheet in a non-standard format and then apply a row aggregation. We demonstrate this by finding the number of male and female athletes born in January 2000 using the Olympic Athlete Bio file.</description>
